## Overview
Three main pieces of software are used to coordinate the recording, annotation, and analysis of movement data associated with CM studies: Qualisys Track Manager (QTM), Theia, and Visual3D.

Eventually, this repo will contain automation-focused improvements to the flow of data between these three applications. Currently, it just contains instructions adapted from internal instruction videos.
